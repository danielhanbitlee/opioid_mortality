    "Since America is in the midst of the opioid epidemic, there is a greater urgency to investigate the cause of the problem. To help with this, I performed exploratory data analysis and looked into predicting the 2016 US county opioid overdose mortality rate given 35 different predictor variables. I believe that if we can make reasonable predictions of county level opioid overdose mortality rate, we can focus on the counties that are predicted to have high opioid overdose mortality rate. This will help us to make better use of our resources as well as study further to help find the cause of the problem. To make predictions, I used 18 different algorithms. In terms of root mean squared error (RMSE), the best model is random forest regression with tuned hyperparameters, which had a mean bootstrap RMSE of 9.25 deaths per 100,000 people. In terms of the fit to the data, the best model seemed to be XGBoost's stochastic gradient descent with tuned parameters, which had a mean bootstrap RMSE of 9.37 deaths per 100,000 people. With this tool, we can now predict any given county's opioid overdose mortality rate. Further investigation should be performed to look into why certain demographic information, such as percentage of county's population who are American Indian or Alaska Native and percentage of county population who are between 45 to 49 years old, plays an important role in predictions.\n",

    "The opioid epidemic or opioid crisis is the rapid increase in the use of prescription and non-prescription opioid drugs  in the United States and Canada beginning in the late 1990s and continuing throughout the next two decades. Opioids are a diverse class of moderately strong painkillers, including oxycodone (commonly sold under the trade names OxyContin and Percocet), hydrocodone (Vicodin), and a very strong painkiller, fentanyl, which is synthesized to resemble other opiates such as opium-derived morphine and heroin.<sup><a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"ref1\">1</a></sup>\n",

    "It's surprising to see that counties with higher population percentage of 45 - 49 year olds have higher opioid overdose mortality rates. This is consistent with the fact that a high percentage of people who died of opioid overdose fall in this age group.\n",

    "To predict opioid overdose mortality rate, I removed county population size estimate. I also converted the `GQ Estimates 2016 (count)` variable to percentage relative to population estimate. The reason for these is because these two variables were in absolute counts. Because they were in absolute counts, these variables caused the smaller counties to have predicted opioid overdose mortality rates of zero. This caused issues because just because the county had small population size did not mean that they would necessarily have zero opioid overdose mortality rate. Removing county population size and converting `GQ Estimates 2016 (count)` to percentages relative to county population size helped solve this problem.\n",

The difference in the bootstrap RMSE means  is 0.13, which is quite small in quantity (9.25 vs 9.37). In practice, this small difference would not make much difference.

    "We have now obtained a tool that we can use to predict a county's opioid overdose mortality rate given 36 variables about the county. This tool is useful for the following reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Once we predict a county's opioid overdose mortality rate, we can then focus on the counties that are predicted to have high opioid overdose mortality rate. This will help us more efficiently allocate resources to combat this epidemic.\n",
    "2. By focusing on the counties that are predicted to have high opioid overdose mortality rates, we can better investigate the cause of opioid addition. Once we find a cause, we can more effectively combat this epidemic.\n",
    "3. We can predict the change in opioid overdose mortality rate when some of the predictor variable values change.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also one finding that is quite surprising. There is no one predictor variable that contribute overwhelmingly to opioid overdose mortality rate. Poverty rate, median household income, and unemployment rates are not the most important predictors in opioid overdose mortality rate. Instead, what we find are variables like the following:\n",

    "* <b>Opioid Prescription Rate (per 100)</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Opioid Prescription Rate (per 100)</b> seems to make sense in that higher <b>Opioid Prescription Rate (per 100)</b> would lead to higher opioid overdose mortality rate.
